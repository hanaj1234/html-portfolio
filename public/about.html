<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a creative and passionate individual who enjoys expressing ideas through design and visual storytelling. I love combining simplicity and meaning in my work, often drawing inspiration from nature and minimalist styles. I’m always eager to learn new techniques and improve my craft, whether it’s through exploring different design concepts or refining my projects. For me, design isn’t just about visuals—it’s about creating something that connects, inspires, and leaves a lasting impression.</p>
